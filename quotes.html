  <p><b>Jurassic Park:  </b>“Tim tried to stay calm, to think it through. For some reason he was getting a consistent error message whenever he tried to turn on a grid. It was saying the power was incompatible with the command he was giving. But what did that mean? Why was power incompatible?” (Crichton 389)</p>
  <p><b>Airframe:  </b>“Typing at the keyboard, she soon had called up the database of associated maintenance packages. She keyed in RT SLATS LK PIN and got the answer she was looking for:” (Crichton 152)</p>
  <p><b>The Andromeda Strain:  </b>“‘These files,’ he said, ‘contain a transcript of autoclock records of the entire flight of Scoop VII. Our purpose in reviewing the transcript is to determine, if possible, what happened to the satellite” (Crichton 134). </p>
  <p><b>The Lost World:  </b>“She turned back to the screen, unsure what to do. She clicked on the cross in the left corner. Nothing happened. She clicked on the upper-left circle. Suddenly, icons began to print rapidly, filling the screen” (Crichton 381).</p>
